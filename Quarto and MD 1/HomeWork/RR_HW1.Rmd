### Task 3
A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
viewers_ep3 <- c(3.47, 3.80, 3.88, 3.70, 3.72, 3.89, 3.41, 3.42, 4.00, 4.48, 3.57, 3.75, 3.36, 3.07, 2.90, 3.20)
viewers_ep5 <- c(3.59, 3.92, 4.07, 3.98, 3.79, 3.82, 3.39, 3.38, 3.98, 4.39, 3.74, 3.85, 3.43, 3.15, 3.02, 3.14)
season_no <- 1:length(viewers_ep3)

for(i in 1:length(viewers_ep3)){
  cat("- Item", viewers_ep3[i], "\n")
}

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(viewers_ep3)
```

---

### Task 4
A graph of the viewership over time.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(y=viewers_ep3, x=1:length(viewers_ep3), xlab ='time')
```

---

### Task 5
A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.

```{r echo=FALSE} 
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(season_no = 1:length(viewers_ep3), view1 = viewers_ep3, view2 = viewers_ep5)
knitr::kable(df, col.names = c("Season No.", "View1", "View2"))

df <- data.frame(x = 1:length(viewers_ep3), v1 = viewers_ep5, v2 = viewers_ep3)
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = v1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = v2)) +
  labs(title = "Comparison", x = "Season No.", y = "Views")
```
