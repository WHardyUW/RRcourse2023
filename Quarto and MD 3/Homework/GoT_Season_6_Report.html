<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>(From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#Premise">Wikipedia</a>) Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. A major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm’s deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting a return to the throne. A third story arc follows the Night’s Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from the North.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="season-6-summary">Season 6 summary</h3>
<p>Alliser Thorne assumes command of the Night Watch, while Ser Davos, and several loyalists bolt themselves inside a room with Jon’s body; Edd leaves Castle Black to seek help. At Winterfell, Ramsay briefly mourns Myranda, while Sansa and Theon are pursued by Bolton men. Brienne and Podrick arrive, killing the pursuers. Sansa formally accepts Brienne into her service. Jaime arrives in King’s Landing with Myrcella’s body and vows to Cersei to take back everything taken from them. Obara and Nymeria murder Trystane Martell while, in Sunspear, Ellaria and Tyene kill Prince Doran and Areo Hotah after Doran learns of Myrcella’s murder. In Meereen, Tyrion and Varys discover ships are burning in the harbor. Jorah and Daario Naharis continue tracking Daenerys, whom the Dothraki take to Khal Moro. In Braavos, a blinded Arya begs on the street. Each day, the Waif beats her with a staff and forces her to fight. In her bedchamber, Melisandre removes her bejeweled necklace revealing she is elderly and frail. In a vision of the past, Brandon sees his father Ned, Uncle Benjen, their sister Lyanna, and young Hodor at Winterfell. Edd returns to Castle Black with Tormund and a group of Wildlings, imprisoning Thorne and the other mutineers. Tommen asks Cersei to help him be strong, as the High Sparrow threatens Jaime. Astapor and Yunkai have reverted to slavery. In the catacombs, Tyrion unchains Rhaegal and Viserion. In Braavos, H’ghar allows Arya to return to the House of Black and White. Roose Bolton’s wife gives birth to a male heir; Ramsay murders Roose, his stepmother, and the infant. En route to Castle Black, Brienne tells Sansa that she had encountered Arya. Theon leaves to head home to the Iron Islands. Euron Greyjoy also returns to Pyke Island and murders his brother, King Balon. Melisandre attempts and apparently fails to resurrect Jon, but after everyone leaves the room, Jon revives. En route to Oldtown to train as a Maester, Samwell first visits Horn Hill, his family home, intending to leave Gilly and Little Sam with his family, claiming Little Sam is his biological son. In a vision, Brandon sees young Ned and Howland Reed, Meera’s father, dishonorably defeat a Targaryen Kingsguardsmen at the Tower of Joy in Dorne. Varys discovers that the masters of Slavers’ Bay are financing the Sons of the Harpy. In King’s Landing, the High Sparrow preaches to Tommen, while Jaime, Cersei and her bodyguard, Ser Gregor Clegane, interrupt a small council meeting, only to be shunned by Kevan Lannister and the Tyrells. The Waif rigorously trains Arya, whose sight is restored after accepting herself as “no-one”. In Winterfell, Lord Umber asks Ramsay to help protect the North from the Wildlings, presenting Rickon Stark, Osha, and the head of Rickon’s direwolf as gifts. Jon executes Thorne, Olly, and the other mutineers. He renounces his oath and puts Tollett in charge of the Night’s Watch. Sansa, Brienne and Podrick arrive at Castle Black. Sansa wants Jon to retake the North. In Meereen, Tyrion offers the masters of Slaver’s Bay peace in exchange for slavery being abolished within seven years; this angers former slaves. Littlefinger returns to the Vale to mobilize its soldiers against Ramsay. Dario learns about Jorah’s greyscale; they find Daenerys in Vaes Dothrak. In King’s Landing, Margaery is allowed to visit Loras while Cersei, Jaime, Kevan, and Olenna shelve their differences and plot to defeat the Sparrows. Theon arrives at Pyke Island and supports Yara’s claim to the Iron Islands throne. In Winterfell, Ramsay kills Osha, who tries to assassinate him. Ramsay sends Jon a message, threatening Rickon unless Sansa is returned. Sansa convinces Jon to retake Winterfell. In the temple of the Dosh Khaleen, Daenerys tells the Khals that she will lead the Dothraki; she ignites the temple, killing them. When she emerges unscathed, the Dothraki bend the knee. Sansa secretly meets with Littlefinger, who offers the Vale’s forces and says her great uncle, Brynden Tully, is building an army in Riverrun. Sansa distrusts Littlefinger declines his help. Jon and Sansa leave Castle Black to gather Northern houses’ support. Sansa sends Brienne to meet with her great-uncle, Brynden Tully. In Braavos, Arya is tasked to assassinate Lady Crane, an actress. Beyond the Wall, Brandon learns that the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers to protect themselves from mankind. In the Iron Islands, Euron wins the Kingsmoot, despite confessing he killed Balon; Yara, Theon, and their supporters flee, taking many ships. In Essos, Daenerys orders Jorah to return after finding a cure for his greyscale. In Meereen, Kinvara, a red priestess, meets Tyrion and Varys and promises to support Daenerys. In Brandon’s unaccompanied vision, the Night King touches him, leaving his mark and making the cave vulnerable. The Night King, White Walkers, and hordes of wights attack the cave, killing the Three-Eyed Raven, several Children, Summer, and Hodor, whose younger self was rendered mentally disabled by Brandon’s interaction, ordering him to, “Hold the door”. Meera escapes the cave with Bran, who is immersed in the Three-Eyed Raven’s transferred visions. In the forest, the wights attack, but a man on horseback saves them. At stately Horn Hill, Sam’s father, Randyll, demeans Sam as a soft bookworm and rejects Gilly for being a Wildling. That night, Sam takes House Tarly’s ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, and leaves with Gilly and Little Sam. Arya warns Lady Crane of her planned assassination, then retrieves Needle. H’ghar allows the Waif to find and kill Arya. Jaime attempts to rescue Margaery from the Faith Militant, only to find she has repented and Tommen has forged an alliance with the Faith. Tommen forbids Jaime to serve as a King’s Guard in King’s Landing and orders him to aid Walder Frey, who is holding Edmure Tully hostage, to retake Riverrun from Brynden Tully. Benjen Stark, the man who saved Meera and Brandon, says he was turned by the White Walkers but later unturned by the Children using Dragonglass. Daenerys mounts Drogon and gives a rousing speech inspiring the Dothraki to cross the Narrow Sea and conquer Westeros for her. The Hound is alive and living a simple, non-violent life, having been saved by a Septon and his followers. When rogue Brotherhood members threaten and eventually slaughter the group, the Hound seeks revenge. Margaery convinces her grandmother to return to Highgarden after the High Sparrow threatens to punish Olenna following her and Jaime’s confrontation with the Faith. Margaery then secretly signals to Olenna that she has not converted to the Faith. Jon, Sansa, and Davos recruit the Wildlings, House Mormont, and others but remain outnumbered by the Boltons. Sansa secretly sends a message to the Vale requesting aid. Jaime arrives in Riverrun with Bronn and assumes command of the siege. Jaime unsuccessfully parleys with Brynden Tully. Theon and Yara spend their last night in Volantis before sailing to Meereen to ally with Daenerys. Arya prepares to return to Westeros until the Waif, disguised as an old crone, viciously stabs her. Tommen abolishes trial by combat, to Cersei’s dismay, who planned to win with Ser Gregor as her champion. In Riverrun, Brienne fails to persuade Bryden Tully to surrender the castle and ride safely North. After Jaime threatens to kill Edmure’s infant son, Edmure enters the castle and orders the Tully forces to stand down. Brynden is killed fighting the Lannisters while Brienne and Podrick escape. Varys departs for Westeros on a secret mission. Meereen comes under naval assault by the slaving cities; Daenerys returns on Drogon, accompanied by the Dothraki. The Hound kills four of the rogues, then encounters Berric Dondarrion and Myr Thoros, who have captured the others. They execute them and ask Clegane to join the Brotherhood. Arya seeks out Lady Crane, who tends her wounds. The Waif kills Lady Crane and pursues Arya through the streets. Arya leads the Waif into darkened catacombs and kills her in the dark, using Needle. Arya places the Waif’s face in the House’s columned collection room and tells H’ghar that she is Arya Stark of Winterfell and she is going home. On Tyrion’s advice, Daenerys meets with three slave masters to negotiate a surrender, which they refuse. Astride Drogon, as Rhaegal and Viserion follow, Daenerys burns the slavers’ fleet. Grey Worm kills two of the masters, leaving one alive to report what he witnessed. Theon and Yara meet with Daenerys and Tyrion to offer an alliance in exchange for the Iron Islands being independent. Near Winterfell, the Stark and Bolton armies meet on the battlefield. Ramsay feigns releasing Rickon before killing him with an arrow. In the battle, the Stark forces are pinned by Bolton soldiers until the Knights of the Vale arrive and overwhelm them. Ramsay flees to Winterfell, but the Wildling giant Wun Wun breaches the gate. Ramsay is taken prisoner; Sansa later watches Ramsay’s starving hounds devour him. Before her trial, Cersei destroys the Sept of Baelor by wildfire, killing the High Sparrow, the Tyrells, Lancel and Kevan Lannister, hundreds of nobles, and the Faith Militant; Qyburn has Pycelle killed. Cersei reveals her incest with Jamie and that she killed Robert Baratheon to Septa Unella before having Ser Robert Strong aka Gregor Clegane torture her until she dies. Distraught over Margaery’s death, Tommen commits suicide. In Dorne, Varys meets with Olenna and Ellaria, seeking an alliance between Daenerys and their Houses against the Lannisters. Davos confronts Melisandre over Princess Shireen’s death, resulting in Jon banishing her. Led by Lyanna Mormont, the Wildlings and the surviving northern Houses pledge loyalty to Jon as King of the North. Sansa rebuffs Littlefinger’s romantic overtures. Arya kills Walder Frey and his sons. Sam and Gilly reach the Citadel in Oldtown. Benjen accompanies Brandon and Meera to the Wall but is unable to go further. In a vision, Bran sees Ned finding Lyanna Stark as she lies dying after giving birth (to Jon Snow) during King Robert’s rebellion. Jaime returns to King’s Landing, and Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys names Tyrion Hand of the Queen and sails for Westeros with the Greyjoys, her armies, and her dragons, leaving Dario Naharis and the Second Sons behind to rule Meereen until new leaders are elected.</p>
