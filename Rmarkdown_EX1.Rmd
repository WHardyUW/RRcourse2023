### Viewership over time

Unluckily, I couldn't find such a data. That's why I decided to use the number of search interest from google trends in order to visualise it

```{r echo=FALSE}

year <- c(2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)

search_interest <- c(28, 38, 61, 100, 68, 52, 44, 40, 37, 35, 49, 49, 42, 39, 36, 37, 38, 36)

trailer_df <- data.frame(year, search_interest)
ggplot(trailer_df, aes(x=year, y=search_interest, group=1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```
