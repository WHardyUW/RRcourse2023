### Viewership over time

Unluckily, I couldn't find such a data. That's why I decided to use the number of search interest from google trends in order to visualise it

```{r echo=FALSE}

year <- c(2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)

search_interest <- c(28, 38, 61, 100, 68, 52, 44, 40, 37, 35, 49, 49, 42, 39, 36, 37, 38, 36)

trailer_df <- data.frame(year, search_interest)
ggplot(trailer_df, aes(x=year, y=search_interest, group=1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

### A graph of season-to-season changes in viewership

```{r echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

# Season vector
season <- c("Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4", "Season 5", "Season 6", "Season 7", "Season 8", "Season 9", "Season 10", "Season 11", "Season 12")

# Average rating vector
avg_rating <- c(8.2, 8.6, 8.6, 8.7, 8.6, 8.6, 8.7, 8.5, 8.4, 8.3, 8.2, 8.1)

# Create a data frame from the vectors
tpb_data <- data.frame(season, avg_rating)

# Order the factor levels of season variable
tpb_data$season <- factor(tpb_data$season, levels = c("Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4", "Season 5", "Season 6", "Season 7", "Season 8", "Season 9", "Season 10", "Season 11", "Season 12"))

# Plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(tpb_data, aes(x=season, y=avg_rating, group=1)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Season") +
  ylab("Average Rating") +
  ggtitle("Trailer Park Boys Seasons and their Average Ratings") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
