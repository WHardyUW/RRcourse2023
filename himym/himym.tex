``How I Met Your Mother'' (often abbreviated as HIMYM) is an American
sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series,
which aired from September 19, 2005, to March 31, 2014, follows the main
character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's
Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke,
and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led
him to meet their mother. ``How I Met Your Mother'' is a joint
production by Bays \& Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television
and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).

The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they
both lived in New York. The vast majority of episodes were directed by
Pamela Fryman, who directed 196 episodes out of 208. The other directors
were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil
Patrick Harris (1 episode).

Known for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic
elements, ``How I Met Your Mother'' was popular throughout its run. It
initially received positive reviews upon release, but reception became
more mixed as the seasons went on. The show was nominated for 91 awards
and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award
for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere,
the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy,
and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor
twice.
